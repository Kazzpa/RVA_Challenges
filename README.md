Robotic challenge in three different scenarios where turtlebot must reach a goal passed as a parameter, planning a path and avoiding obstacles while trying to perform in the shortest time possible.
The code for the three different scenarios are the same, but parameters are different.

# Robotic Challenge
Robotic challenge in three different scenarios where turtlebot must reach a goal passed as a parameter, planning a path and avoiding obstacles while trying to perform in the shortest time possible. There are three different scenarios which are described here and there are some screenshots in the bottom of the readme.
-  **Scenario 1:** Room with all obstacles defined in map which are considered in planning phase
- **Scenario 2**: Room with at least an obstacle undefined in map that can't be considered in planning phase
- **Scenario 3:** Robotics labs that could have obstacles.

# Dependencies:
[Ros kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation)
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
# Usage
The challenge has three different scenarios and there is a way to execute each one.  
All of them will work with the same nodes and algorithms but will have different parameters.  

In order to import the module you should create the pkg with the following command `catkin_create_pkg robotics_challenge rospy`  and move /robotics_challenge content in it.
You must prepare the project folder before launching any scenario: `source ./devel/setup.bash` in your project directory.

Scenario 1:  
```
roslaunch robotics_challenge robotics_challenge1.launch
```  
Scenario 2:  
```
roslaunch robotics_challenge robotics_challenge2.launch  
```
Scenario 3:  
```
roslaunch robotics_challenge robotics_challenge3.launch  
```

# Nodes
- [Control Node](#control-node)
- [Orca Node](#orca-node)
- [Planner Node](#planner-node)
## Control Node:
##### It manages the route to follow and calculates the direction in which to move, taking into account the distance to the next point of the route and the direction in which it is located. It will control the exception that can give orca, solving it with a bug algorithm, in which it will always move towards a direction, to avoid possible collisions that the orca algorithm cannot solve. On the other hand, it will publish a marker that will refer to the point to which it has to move at the moment, represented as a small blue sphere.

### Topics:
##### Publisher:
 - Twist **/cmd_vel/tracker**
 - Twist **/cmd_vel_mux/input/navi**
 - Marker **/visualization_marker**
##### Subscriber:
 -  Bool **/is_goal_within_obstacle**
 -  Path **/path_plan**
### Parameters:
 -  Path **path:** List of points the robot must follow,undefined until callback from /path_plan.
 -  Bool **path_set:** Variable to know if path has already been defined or not.
 -  Bool **skipping_goal:** Defines if orca had a problem finding a new movement to avoid obstacles, set in callback from /is_goal_within_obstacle
 -  Float **skip_goal_max_distance:** Max distance where a goal will be skipped if skipping_goal is True
 - Float **goal_tolerance:** Distance where a goal will be considered reached.
 - Float **linear_max:** Max linear speed robot will be able to move.
 - Float **angular_max:** Max angular speed robot will be rotating.
 - Float **angle_tolerance:** Degrees where the robot will move slower and adjust the rotation.
 - Float **linear_turning:** Speed the robot will be moving when turning to achieve the degrees to goal defined in angle_tolerance.
### Functions:
  - **__main__**: It initializes the node and defines the time ratio to which the command function will be executed, by which iterates the points of the path.
 - **command ( Int i )**:  calculates the linear and angular speed to achieve the current goal without exceed the limits defined, also manages if a goal in path should be skipped when called from `/is_goal_within_obstacle` , if the goal should be skipped it will calculate a new linea and angular velocity based in a bug algorithm to avoid the obstacle, this will be called if an exception has been raised in orca node . 
Returns the current or next index in path , and a boolean to determine if the current goal was reached.
 - **path_received ( Path path )**: callback of `/path_plan` which sets the path.
 - **skip_goal ( Bool skipping_goal )**: callback of `/is_goal_within_obstacle` which sets skipping_goal to true if the goal is unreachable by orca.
 - **robot_closer_next_goal ( Int i )**: Returns the next point of the path that is closer to the current position of turtlebot
 - **publish ( Float lin_vel Float ang_vel )**: publish to the `/cmd_vel/tracker` topic the  desirable speed which will be sent to Orca node.
 - **publish_navi ( Float lin_vel,Float ang_vel )**: publish to the `/cmd_vel_mux/input/navi` topic the speed to move, this function will only be called if skipping_goal is set to true, as a way to resolve a local minimun in with orca algorithm.
 - **marker_goal ( Float goalx,Float goaly )**: Publish to `/visualization_marker` the next goal so we can visualize it in rviz.
## Orca Node:
##### In charge of avoiding the obstacles received by the radar and therefore transform the speed coming from control node to one that avoids these obstacles, if not possible send a signal to control to solve the problem.
### Topics:
##### Publisher:
 - Twist **/cmd_vel_mux/input/navi**
 -  Bool **/is_goal_within_obstacle**
 - Marker **/visualization_marker**
##### Subscriber:
 - Twist **/cmd_vel/tracker**
 - LaserScan **/scan**
### Parameters:
 -  Float **linear_threshold:** Threshold where if isn't exceeded orca won't take action.
 -  Float **linear_max:** Max linear speed robot will be able to move.
 -  Float **radius:** Radius of the obstacle, which are named Agents in orca.
 -  Float **delta_t:** Time between every call to orca, which is defined as rate of sleep.
 -  Float* **max_distance_obstacle:** Max distance where a obstacle will be considered by orca to be avoided
 -  Array **v_orca:** Speed considered for orca in vector 
 -  Float **linear:** Linear speed to be published after being calculated
 -  Float **angular:** Angular speed to be published after being calculated
### Functions:
  - **__main__**: It initializes the node and sets it to sleep while not shutdown has been invoked.
  - **callback_cmd_vel ( Float [] data)**: Invoked if received from `/cmd_vel/tracker`, transform the speed in to a vector and saves it as v_orca, as it will be used by orca.
  - **callback_scan ( LaserScan Data)**: analyzes the obstacles retrieved from LaserScan, filters the ones who are farther than max_distance_obstacle, and transform v_orca in a new vector to avoid the obstacles. If orca can't transform the direction a new one, it will raise an exception and True will be send in `/is_goal_within_obstacle` topic 
  - **publish ( Float lin_vel, Float ang_vel)**: publish the calculated velocity to turtlebot.
  - **orca_apply ( Agent [] agents)**: calls orca algorithm to resolve which direction must the robot move to avoid obstacles. More info in their own repo linked in credits.
 
## Planner Node:
##### Will calculate a path to the goal avoiding obstacles defined in the costmap, this will be calculated once. We will be using an a -star algorithm considering both the travelled distance and the distance to goal.
### Topics:
##### Publisher:
 - Marker **/path**
 -  Path **/path_plan**
##### Subscriber:
 - OccupancyGrid **/costmap_2d/costmap/costmap**
### Parameters:
 -  String **goal_path:** File path to save the path plan.
 -  Float [] **init:** Init coords where the robot will start the path.
 -  Float [] **goal:** Goal coords that the robot must reach
### Functions:
  - **__main__**: It initializes the node and sets it to sleep while not shutdown has been invoked.
  - **map_callback**: Retrieves the information from `/costmap_2d/costmap/costmap` and calls calculate_pat, publish_path_msg, publish_path_marker, and finally saveAsYaml functions
  - **calculate_path (Float [] init, Float [] goal)**:  will call the dijkstra algorithm that is modified to work as an AStar algorithm, and return the points that compose the path.
  - **publish_path_msg(Path path)**: Once calculated by calculate_path this will reverse the list of points as they come from the goal to init, and it will publish in `/path_plan` topic so the robot can star following it.
  - **publish_path_marker(path path)**: This will publish the path as Markers in `/path` so rviz can visualize it.
  - **save_as_yaml(Path path)**: Saves the path as a yaml so a node can read it as ros params, this was used before the topic path_plan was created.
 ### Comparision between astar and dijkstra planning 
We can see that the dijkstra algorithm takes a lot more of points into account, and isn't going in a certain direction,
 while astar takes in account the distance to the goal, will take the points that are forward the goal.
